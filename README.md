# Gebeya-web-app
A responsive web app for gebeya market app's figma design. In this project I converted the figma ddesign for Gebeya market app in to a responsive website.

#Features
The project has three pages : the home page,cart page and the checkout page. Inside the home page , users can click the add to cart button to add items to cart and this will take them to the cart page where they can see the overview of the item added to the cart.Inside the cart page there is a button with the text of checkout which directs the user to the checkout page to finish the process. And when they do so,they will be redirected back to the home page.    Also, they can increase, decrease the quantity of the added item and they can remove the item from the cart in the cart page.
